Silverlight 4 already supports right to left languages such as Persian/Arabic/Hebrew but it lacks .NET Framework's Persian calendar support. So I've decided to create a new open source project to add these missing features.

Update:
---
Thanks to Microsoft, Now Silverlight 5 supports .NET Framework's Persian calendar.
